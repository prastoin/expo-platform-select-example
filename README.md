## How I created this repo

To create and setup the demonstration repository you need to have [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your computer.

### Create the app

```bash
npx create-expo-app YOUR-APP-NAME
```

### Setup typescript

To setup typescript create an empty `tsconfig.json` file.

```bash
touch tsconfig.json
```

Then run `expo start`, it will find the `tsconfig.json` and detect that typescript dependencies are not installed and will ask for them to be installed.

```bash
expo start
```
